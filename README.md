# Verto: An Educational Graphing Tool
https://spudmelf.github.io/verto.github.io/

Verto is an interactive graphing tool designed to teach 
people about graphical transformations for common functions 
they are likely to encounter in algebra and calculus classes.
Verto's Scratch like UI was inspired by my own experiences teaching CS;
I noticed student engagement was significantly higher when using Scratch,
and I sought to emulate that engagement.  

The backbone of Scratch's graphing system is borrowed from Ricahrd Ye's graphr website.
